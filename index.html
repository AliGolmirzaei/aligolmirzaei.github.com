<h1>Samitco (Saman Intelligent Techniques Co)</h1>
<p> The overall aim of this company is: ECU Calibration (emission, fuel consumption, performance, monitoring and diagnostic, ..), ECU hardware/software development and Technical consulting.</p>
<p><a href="http://samitco.com/WathWeDo.html">WebSite</a></p>
<h3>Data logger</h3>
<p>Today a vehicle producer needs to test a newly designed vehicle before mass producing it. These tests called fleet test. In this test the company produces noticable number of cars and sends all of them to travel over the country to make sure that new vehicle withstand all climates, altitudes, special conditions and etc. These tests are normally take long time and they are expensive. Thus, if a small problem observed in these tests there is no need to reschedule the test. Engineers only fix that small problems and company continue to production. But for engineer to be able to understand the problem they need a set of data showing on what condition and state the problem raised. For EMS calibration teams, like the company I have worked on, these data are the ECU variables. To capture such variables one need some hardware and some skills. Up until now companies in my country used to send a specialist with the driver on the trip to gather and send data. But this is so much expensive in addition to lots of side effects such as reduced number of tested vehicles. To solve this our company decided to produce a data logger to capture the ECU variables with a cheap hardware and without the need of any especial skills to use.</p>
<p>So far we builded a hardware based on ARM microcontroller be able to connect to ECU by use of OBD connector and can support both KWP2000 and UDS (CAN protocol) standard. It receives the recording parameters from a USB cool disk and stores the data on the same disk. In addition to ECU communication it communicates to a GPS module and stores the current location of the vehicle on the disk too.</p>
<p>Beside these, this data logger is capable of bridging between computer and ECU. So another USB port added on the device to receive data from a computer (by using virtual com port) and send them to ECU.</p>
<p>Although its features are well enough now, but the company planned to embed a GSM/GPRS module into the device to send some reports regularly or even make the data live on the internet (so cool).</p>

<h3>EF7 engine calibration</h3>
<p>EF7 is the first Irainian engine designed by cooperation of the FEV Germany. By time passing on the ECU that used on that engine (Bosch ME7) becomes obsolete. So Iran Khodro that has produced EF7, needs to find an alternative. Their choice is Bosch ME17. But, ME17 is a different hardware and even with different software, so calibration needs to be cary out again. And this what they expect us to do.</p>
<p>Calibration is a long and complex task. In it, you need to fill tens of thousands of tables. My contributions to this project are</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimum load by manifold pressure: We need to know how much fuel we should inject into the cylinder to achieve a perfect combustion. By calculating the amount of air going in the cylinder we can calculate the needed fuel. The air amount can be measured or modeled. In the modeled system it can be a variable of throttle opening or manifold pressure.</li>
<li>Driver desired throttle by torque model: EF7 has an electrically powered throttle. So when the driver pushes the gas pedal the ECU decides how much throttle should be opened. In ME17 the pedal value converted to a torque amount and that torque converted to throttle in a torque model.</li>
<li>Drivability: This means to don't cause the vehicle to oscillation and jerk when accelerating and decelerating. Gearbox always has backlash, besides, transmission system has lots of stiffness. When a vehicle switches from polling to trailing or reverse the compression needs to be decompressed, then the gap should be filled and eventually compression in the oposite direction. If you do these steps badly vehicle will jerk. My task was to profile the torque to achieve a smooth transition between acceleration and deceleration</li>
<li>O2 sensor monitoring: any failure on o2 sensor should be cached by ECU before any major emission</li>
<li>Misfire detection: Missfire is a condition when fuel doesn't burn on the cylinder by any means. It causes emission on low rates and catalyst melting in high rates. ECU should detect this fault and turn the MIL lamp on or cut off the fuel for respective cylinder depending on the number of misfires</li>
<li>Cold start, hot start, restart: On this condition, the amount of fuels that burn in cylinder is not equal to what you injected, so an increase or a decrease should be calculated and considered on injection</li>
<li>Catalyst heating, warm up: Components of engine, especially catalyst won't work well till they warmed up enough. ECU can speed up this by retarding the spark and increasing the exhaust gas temperature</li>
</ul>

<h3>Resource preparing tool</h3>
<p>All contents that showed in app needed to be prepared. It is also desired to publish some of the contents in website too. In addition to these, some information should be extracted from resources, like the list of courses. For website we use JEKYLL. So I developed a python application with relatively same input as JEKYLL that satisfies our needs like resource encryption, create a database containing all of the words used in resources, text audio alignment for highlighting the text in sync with audio, app faq and many more. We also create a git for our contents and link this tool to it. It means after a content addition or change it automatically call the preparing tool and after that, it deploys the content to the server, a fully automatic toolchain. really cool.</p>
<h3>Server sided codes</h3>
<p>In application, we offer lots of online features. Some of them are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication and signup</li>
<li>Latest course list and course selection</li>
<li>Data backup and restore</li>
<li>Contact us</li>
<li>Annouymous error reporting</li>
<li>Forum visualization</li>
<li>Auto update</li>
</ul>
<p>These features powered by some PHP codes that I developed.</p>

<h2>Faran fan arya</h2>
<p>The overall aim of this company was to design, manufacture, and develop of CNC machines and automation technologies. My main work on this company was to develop software and electronic equipment. The reason that I decided to do things out of my study was that all of the company members were mechanical engineers and because I was one of the company funders I wanted it to survive so I picked works that no one accepted. Unfortunately, the company went bankrupt but at least I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Our most bold work there was the creation of pc based 3-4axis CNC machines. I developed some electronics boards (mostly interfaces) to bridge between motor's and actuator's drivers and pc. I also customized Linuxcnc as G-code parser, machine controller, and GUI.</p>
<p>Beside these, I designed and manufactured a digitizer probe that used for automatic tool length measurement and engraving surface detection with the use of python scripts which I embed in Linuxcnc. Engraving surface detection means to map a 2D machining plan (G-code) to a nonPlanar surface (3d plan)</p>

<h1>MS. Project - swarm robotic platform</h1>
<p><em>Design and construction of two-wheeled mobile robot platform with the ability to connect to other robots with two rotational degrees of freedom.</em></p>
<p>By this project, we achieved a low-cost swarm robot platform that handles the general problems of an experimental research and allows the researchers to focus on their main context. This means the platform controllers would work in a cascade mode. The inner controllers are in the platform microcontroller and the higher ones are in researcher's area. Our main controllers in the platform are battery management system and dc motor's PID controllers. Unfortunately, because of not providing any fund by the university I was only able to create a prototype with my own money.</p>

<h1>Nasir Virtual Reality Laboratory (VirLab)</h1>
<p>Nasir Virlab is a laboratory at KNTU university. I first started working in the lab because of my interest in the domain. Our first project was a small motion simulator and we designed a basic AI vehicle for it that only followed a path. After this project, lab develope the project to a more broad domain and also got sponsorships from a company (bus driving company). As a result, they planned to produce various bus simulators for the purpose of training. I got a part on designing AI vehicle's engine, pursue to my past contribution. I cooperated with a team of students created an AI engine with path planning, path following (AI vehicles had simplified dynamic model, So we control them with a realistic steering and traction), collision avoiding (anticipating position and reaction to a chance of collision) and respecting traffic rules like traffic lights. Unfortunately, I don't have any video of my work but I have some pictures of the virtual environment.</p>

<h1>BS. project - Heart signal proccessing</h1>
<p><em>Design and Computerized Implementation of a Low-Computation-Burden, Noise-Robust and Device-Independent Cardiac System Electro-mechanical Signal Processor aimed for Detection of RAT Heart Signal Events-Delineation and Alternans Calculation.</em></p>
<p>Through this project, we achieved a program that could be run on low-speed processors like cell phone processors. Actually, our goal was to prepare a system to allow unskilled persons in rural hospitals be able to interpret patient's heart state. The first stage on this issue was to delineate the signal and after that some basic statistical analysis and some more complex pattern recognition. My task was the first part, delineation. I used signal concavity as my main measure. The concavity carried out by rolling average to eliminate noise. It also eliminated baseline changing of the signal, a common issue on signals. Then it used a Schmitt trigger (hysteresis) with a dynamic threshold. This will end to detection of the signal pick points. Then further analysis would carry out to validate the point and also detect other events on the signal.</p>
